# React Native Application
## Student ID: 11014111
### Project Overview
This is a basic React Native application created using Expo CLI. It was created for my second assignment in Mobile Application Development. 

_In this README, follow 'Project Tasks' if you want to do this from scratch or 'Clone This Repository' if you want to clone this repository to your local machine_

### Project tasks
- Open your terminal and navigate to the directory you want to have this app
- Create a blank expo app with the following command (replace _AppName_ with what you want to name your app)
```
npx create-expo-app AppName --template blank
```
- Open the app in a code editor (I used VSCode)
- Run the following command and follow the instructions to see any changes made to the app in real time
```
npx expo start
```
- In the App.js file,
   - edit the background colour of the `View` component
   - change the text in the `Text` component to 'My name is 'YourName'' (replace _YourName_ with your actual name)
   - change the font size of the text to 24
   - make the name (_YourName_) bold
- Take a screenshot of the app on your phone/emulator and add the screenshot to the parent folder
- Create a README file explaining what your app does

### Clone This Repository
- Open your terminal and navigate to the folder you want this repository to be cloned.
- Paste the following command
```
git clone https://github.com/favourrr-a/rn-assignment2-11014111.git
```
- Navigate to the project directory
```
cd rn-assignment2-11014111
